# Playbook Workflow

This project uses the **Playbook task harness**.  Follow these rules on every
session — they govern how you work, not what you build.

## Start of Session

Run this first, before anything else:

    .claude/bin/tasks bootstrap

It prints the project mind map, pending tasks, and the full CLI reference.
Read it.  Then ask the user what to work on, or pick the highest-priority
pending task.

## Before Editing Code

You **must** activate a task before touching any code file:

    .claude/bin/tasks work <N>      # e.g. tasks work 042

This sets the active task.  Without it, edits are blocked.

## Working Through a Task

- Read the task.md that `tasks work` prints.
- Work **one gate at a time**: read the gate → do the work → check the box
  (append your outcome on the same line) → move to the next gate.
- Never skip gates.  Never batch-close multiple gates in one edit.
- If you discover new work, add new gates to task.md immediately.

## End of Task

    .claude/bin/tasks work done

This deactivates the task and marks it done.  Run it when all gates are
checked — not before.

## CLI Reference

{cli_ref}

## Do Not

- Edit `.agent/sessions/` files directly — use `tasks work` / `tasks work done`.
- Create `.agent/tasks/NNN-name/` directories manually — use `tasks new`.
- Close multiple gates in a single edit.
- Start coding without an active task.

  list [--pending]    List all tasks with status
  status              Show head position for active tasks
  plan-review <N>     Run blind plan review
  impl-review <N>     Run blind implementation review
  panel-review [<N>]  Multi-model judge panel
                      --prompt "..."     add steering (appended to review prompt, or full mission if no task)
                      --no-mind-map      strip mind map from context
                      --bare             no context at all; --prompt is the entire prompt
  retro [--since N]   Project retrospective
  global-retro-collect --since DATE [--machine NAME] [--out DIR] [--format zip|tgz] ROOT [ROOT...]
                      Collect Playbook artifacts for a global retro archive
  context <N>         Extract chat messages for a task
  prepare-merge [--target <branch>] [--dry-run]
                      Renumber tasks, re-sequence chat_log, report MIND_MAP collisions
                      so the branch merges cleanly into target (default: main)
  doctor              Harness health check
  merge-doctor <src> [tgt]  Audit a cross-namespace merge for contamination
  bootstrap           Load mind map + skills + pending tasks
  init                Create CLAUDE.md for this project
