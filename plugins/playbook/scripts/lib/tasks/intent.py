"""Intent review — the "vertical retro".

Infers intent independently from the four layers of a single work unit
(chat_log -> task.md -> code/diff -> tests), blind, via the judge sandbox; the
main agent + user then reconcile the four reports in-session. See task 141.

This is the depth-wise sibling of `tasks retro` (horizontal, across many tasks).
Vertical drills down ONE unit's stack and checks coherence top-to-bottom; the
three seams localize where drift entered:
    chat -> task.md   = comprehension
    task.md -> code   = execution
    code -> tests     = verification

Stdlib-only (runtime invariant): shells out to `git` for the code/test layers.
The model only does the 4 blind extractions; reconciliation/grading is human.
