"""Detect silently-stopped gate logging (bug report #4).

state-echo-hook records each gate transition into a lane's `chat_log.md` as a
`**[G<task>:<line>]**` entry, and message submissions as `**[M<n>]**`. On one
machine (cristi's Windows lane) the G-entries stopped at task 064 while tasks
kept running to ~110 with full gate discipline — a silent retro-fidelity loss
(`build_task_windows` in retro.py attributes messages to tasks via G-entries).

This module provides a pure, testable detector used by `tasks doctor` §1e. It
is deliberately conservative (only warns when the log is provably alive and the
gap is real) so it never cries wolf on a fresh or idle lane.
