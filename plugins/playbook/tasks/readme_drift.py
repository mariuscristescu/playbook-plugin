"""README drift detection (task 017) — maintainer-only advisory check.

Warns when the playbook-plugin SOURCE repo's user-facing surface has moved
past the last README audit baseline (docs/readme-audit-baseline.json, written
by the maintainer skill at .claude/skills/readme-audit/SKILL.md).

Fires ONLY in maintainer contexts, detected by two signals:
  1. module-path walk — this module itself lives inside a plugin source
     checkout (the working-copy CLI was run directly), or
  2. child-checkout scan — the current project root has a plugin source
     checkout as a direct child (the dogfooding-workspace layout, where the
     daily CLI resolves to the installed cache copy so signal 1 never fires).

A "plugin source checkout" must have plugins/playbook/.claude-plugin/plugin.json,
README.md, and .git at its root, and must NOT live under ~/.claude/plugins:
the marketplaces/ tree there is a full git clone of the repo (content-
indistinguishable from a dev checkout), and installed cache copies have no
.git and no repo-root files, so ordinary host installs can never match.

The trigger is baseline-coverage, not commit recency: a README-only typo
commit cannot reset it — only re-running the audit (which moves the baseline
commit) does. All failures are soft; callers additionally wrap in try/except
(doctor's "must never crash on an advisory check" contract).
