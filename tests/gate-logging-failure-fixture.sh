# Fixture for the state-echo-hook gate-logging write-failure warning (task 018 /
# bug report #4). A write that fails AFTER the AGENT_WRITABLE probe (e.g. a
# Windows AV lock on the counter mv, or a non-writable sessions dir) used to be
# swallowed by `set -e` — the hook died mid-write, the gate_key froze, and gate
# logging stopped with NO warning. The fix guards the writes (fail-open) and
# surfaces a loud warning, suppressed inside a sandboxed judge.
#
# Run: bash claude-playbook-plugin/tests/gate-logging-failure-fixture.sh
# Exit 0 if all scenarios pass, non-zero on first failure.
