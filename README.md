# Claude Playbook

A Claude Code plugin for building software you can trust. The agent remembers your project across sessions, works in small reviewed tasks, and tests as it builds.

> **Fork notice** — This is an independent fork of [Claude Playbook](https://github.com/horiacristescu/claude-playbook-plugin), created by **Horia Cristescu**, maintained by **Marius Cristescu** for our own feature development. It ships as a separate marketplace (`playbook-x-marketplace`), so install *either* this fork or the upstream — never both at once. The [Install](#install) section below points at this fork.

→ [Slide deck](https://horiacristescu.github.io/claude-playbook-plugin/docs/Playbook.pdf) — where Playbook fits among current coding agent harnesses (April 2026).

## What it looks like

```
You:    "Add rate limiting to the API endpoints"
Agent:  creates task, writes a 12-gate plan
Judge:  reviews the plan blind (no conversation access - no anchoring)
Agent:  works gate by gate, checking boxes, annotating findings
You:    (20 minutes later) read the task.md, see exactly what happened and why
```

## task.md - plan and runtime

Work happens in task.md files. The agent works through gates top to bottom, checking boxes and annotating as it goes. You can run a judge on the plan before any code is written - blind, no conversation access. A fresh session picks up the same file and continues from wherever the last one stopped.

Each operation leaves a mark - a judge verdict, a checked gate with a note, a flagged wrong turn. When the task is done, it's the record of what happened and why.

The plan changes as work progresses. The agent edits gates as it learns - steps get added or removed as reality demands. A reflection gate mid-task asks "am I solving the stated problem or a different one?" and the remaining plan gets revised from the answer. You steer by chatting at any point - "wrong approach," "focus on X."

Claude, Cursor, and others will generate a checkboxable plan when you ask. But it's static - it doesn't edit itself as reality changes, it doesn't record what happened, and it disappears when the session ends. task.md grows.

Because state lives in the file and not in memory, execution survives context compaction. Tasks that run to 500+ steps work reliably - useful when you need to apply a templated analysis or transformation across a large collection of files.

## What comes with it

**The mind map** (`MIND_MAP.md`) is the project's memory - persistent across tasks and sessions. It captures both directions: intent and goals from the top down, architecture and structure from the bottom up. A new agent reads it at session start and is oriented in seconds, not minutes. Session thirty picks up from session one without re-learning anything.

**The judge** reads the task plan before any code gets written. It sees the full codebase but not your conversation - no anchoring to whatever approach you already committed to in chat. On complex tasks, run a panel of several models; the hit rate on catching real problems goes up.

**The chat log** records every message you send. A gate in the design phase checks the task against it - pulling in things you said conversationally but never wrote down. If your messages and the task don't agree, that's a bug in the plan, not just a documentation gap.

**Hooks** enforce the structure at the system level. The agent can't edit code without an active task, can't skip gates, can't mark work done with gates still open. Warnings don't stick, so we block instead.

**Tests** make the consequences of a wrong change visible immediately - the agent sees the failure and corrects course. The better the tests, the longer it can run unsupervised. Playbook leans heavily on this: the task.md template puts a test gate after each work gate, and we recommend expanding test coverage as part of every task.

**The sandbox** lets you run the agent in full bypass-permissions mode - no prompts, no interruptions. The tradeoff is that blast radius is contained at the OS level: your project directory is writable, `.git` is read-only, and everything outside the project is blocked. You get the speed of unattended execution without the risk of it touching anything it shouldn't.

## Install

```
claude plugin marketplace add mariuscristescu/playbook-plugin
claude plugin install playbook@playbook-x-marketplace
```

Restart Claude Code, then in any project tell the agent `/playbook:init`. This creates `CLAUDE.md`, `MIND_MAP.md`, and `.claude/bin/tasks` - the task CLI.

Then run `/playbook:mindmap` to build the initial mind map. The agent spends time mapping your code, tests, and docs - while you explain the goals and constraints that aren't in the code. The result is an agent that knows the internal geometry of your project before it touches anything. This is necessary, not optional: the mind map is the agent's memory and its starting point for every session that follows.

If your test coverage is thin, do this before anything else: ask the agent to propose and write tests. Once you have both the mind map and a solid test suite, you have everything you need to run playbook safely on real work.

To upgrade later: `/playbook:upgrade`.

## Usage

Tell the agent what you want. It creates a task, writes a plan, gets the plan reviewed, then works through the gates - you chat, the agent runs the commands.

```
You:    "Add rate limiting to the API endpoints"
Agent:  tasks new feature rate-limiting
Agent:  tasks plan-review 12
Agent:  tasks work 12
Agent:  [works gate by gate]
Agent:  tasks work done
```

For plan review before the agent touches any code, ask for it explicitly:

```
You:    "review the plan before coding"
Agent:  tasks plan-review 12       # single judge, blind
Agent:  tasks panel-review 12      # 7-model panel, higher discovery rate
```

For hands-off execution, run in sandbox mode - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` inside OS-level write containment:

```
sandbox
```

The sandbox uses macOS seatbelt or Linux bubblewrap. Your project directory is writable, `.git` is read-only, everything outside is blocked at the kernel level. The agent runs without permission prompts but can't escape the containment even if it tries. You still steer by chatting.

Tell the agent what you want built, what constraints matter, and what done looks like. You can steer at any point by chatting - but as the mind map fills in, the agent learns the project's quirks and needs less of it. If you want to follow along, task.md is easier to watch than the chat feed - you see from above, gates checking one by one, outcomes piling up. When it finishes, every decision is recorded and every test result is there.

## Configuration

Per-install review knobs live in `.agent/config.json` (created by `/playbook:init`, hand-editable):

```json
{
  "judge_budget_usd": 2,
  "review_timeout_secs": 300
}
```

- `judge_budget_usd` — spend cap for the **claude** judge (`--max-budget-usd`). Claude-only; codex/agy/grok/pi have no budget knob.
- `review_timeout_secs` — hard timeout for every review agent (plan / impl / panel). On expiry the whole process tree is terminated and the prior review log is left untouched. (Single-judge `plan-review` / `impl-review` previously had *no* timeout — they now default to 300s like the panel; raise it if your reviews legitimately run longer.)

Precedence, highest first: **CLI flag** (`--budget`, `--timeout` on `plan-review` / `impl-review` / `panel-review`) → **env var** (`PLAYBOOK_JUDGE_BUDGET_USD`, `PLAYBOOK_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_SECS`) → **`.agent/config.json`** → built-in default. A missing file or malformed value falls back to the default (surfaced by `tasks doctor`, never fatal).

### Judge model pins (`.agent/models.json`)

Judge selection lives in `models.json`: the plugin ships defaults in `provider/models.json`, and each install can shadow them per key with a gitignored `.agent/models.json` (`default_judge`, `panel`, `aliases`). Pinned model ids rot as providers ship and retire models, so the pins have a maintenance loop:

- `tasks models check` audits every pin against **live availability**: codex pins are probed with a tiny prompt (the `~/.codex/models_cache.json` catalog alone doesn't prove your account can use a model), claude pins are probed budget-capped (claude has no list command — new ids enter via `--claude-candidates`), grok pins are checked against `grok models` (a login-aware entitlement list, so a listed pin is OK without a live turn), agy is unverifiable (`--model` is inert in `--print` mode; the judge always runs whatever model is selected in the agy UI). `--no-probe` is the free/fast degraded audit. Exits 1 when any pin can't run as configured.
- `tasks models select` refreshes interactively: shows the report, takes the new panel + default judge, writes `.agent/models.json` — creating it on fresh installs and preserving keys it doesn't manage.
- `tasks doctor` warns (never fails) on a missing models.json or dead pins, using the cheap checks only.
- When a review judge fails **specifically because its model no longer exists** — probe-confirmed, not just pattern-matched — the review still saves its output, then prints the availability report and exits nonzero: a deliberate hard stop so you re-pin before trusting a degraded panel. Timeouts, budget caps, and other errors keep their soft behavior.
- A judge that exhausts its budget cap is reported as **failed** with an explicit notice (raise `judge_budget_usd` or pass `--budget`) instead of masquerading as a successful empty review.

## Two agents, one task

One setup that works well: the **orchestrator** runs outside the sandbox - writes plans, reviews results, commits. The **sandbox agent** runs in bypass mode - picks up the task.md and builds. The task.md is the handoff. Different agents across different sessions can pick up the same task and keep going from wherever it stopped.

## The mind map in practice

> **[1] Project Overview** - Claude Playbook packages an agent steering methodology as a distributable plugin **[2]**. The core insight: the solution to agent autonomy is text, not code **[18]**. Refined across 700+ tasks...
>
> **[5] Task System** - Each task is a living document that IS the execution trace **[19]**. Design Phase → Work Plan → Pre-review. Task types: feature → Build, explore → Investigate, review → Evaluate...
>
> **[19] Document-Driven Execution** - task.md is a computational model: checkboxes = state, sections = memory, templates = instruction set, agent = interpreter **[5]**...

Nodes cross-reference each other - **[5]** links to **[19]** which links back. What was decided, what failed, what got tried and why - it persists between sessions instead of being re-explained from scratch.

## When not to use it

Not everything needs a task. Questions, shell commands, docs, git - just ask. The rule is simple: the moment the agent touches code files, declare a task first. The hooks enforce this.

Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.
